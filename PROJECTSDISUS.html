            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>This project uses Arduino Uno to control the system. The Arduino Board is programmed using the Arduino IDE software. The system uses the moisture sensor, two DHT11 sensors, DC water pump, and DC fan. DHT11 measures the humidity and temperature of the surrounding. The first DHT11 sensor used in the greenhouse, if the values of temperature and humidity are above the threshold values, then the fan starts rotating to cool down the surrounding. Moisture sensor measures the level of moisture content in the soil and based on the average moisture value, it sends the signal to the Arduino if watering is required. The sensors sense the respective parameters, and data is sent to the monitoring unit as well as shown on the LCD screen. The water pump supplies water to the plants until the desired moisture level is reached. Whenever the soil condition is dry, the microcontroller sends a command to the relay, and the motor gets switched on and supplies water to the field. If the soil gets wet, the motor gets switched off.
                The rechargeable battery that supplies required power source is recharged via the solar panel. The solar tracking system comprises a solar panel, Arduino microcontroller, and sensors. For this system to operate, there must be emission of light through the sun. These solar panels charge the rechargeable batteries which are used to drive loads in the failure of supply and in day times from the panel. The power is supplied to the DC motor that helps to pump the water based on the reference value and stops watering when it reaches the threshold value. The power is also supplied to the DC motor fan to cool down the temperature in the greenhouse. If the temperature increases, then the DC fan automatically starts to cool down. Blynk is an IoT platform for Android smartphones that is used to control Arduino via the internet. This application is used to create a graphical interface by compiling and providing the appropriate address on the available widgets. Through this app, we can monitor the temperature, humidity, moisture content in soil on smartphones. Ranchers can monitor the status of the agriculture field through the mobile from any place.
